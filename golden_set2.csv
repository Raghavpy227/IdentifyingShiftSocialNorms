Granted, we have a large family and a lot of computers so your experience may differ.\\n\\nBuy a Kilowatt meter to measure the power draw from your computers, tvs, chargers, etc.\\n\\nGo after big-ticket items first. In our house, that was the AC and Pool Pumps. We raised the thermostat to 80F during the day and only cool to 72F after the sun goes down. This only brought our bill down to $800/mo. If I owned the house, I would upgrade these to newer, more efficient models.\\n\\nIf I owned the house, I would also invest in weatherization, replacing single pane windows with high insulation, double pane. Sealing all doors, windows, outlets, etc.\\n\\nNext, we replaced all the lights with CFLs. The 9W kind. Unless you are reading, you don\'t need a lot of light to avoid stubbing your toe. Don\'t forget the lights that you forget about and leave on for days at a time. My garage lights were like this, nearly forgot to replace them. Turns out they were 300W now replaced by 18W of CFL. Also, get those infra-red sensors that turn outside lights on/off automatically.\\n\\nWe already had energy efficient appliances.\\n\\nTurn off computers when they are not in use. A computer and screen costs about 1KWH every five hours. In CA, at $0.41/KWH, that\'s a bit over $2/day. FYI, your Xbox/PS/Wii is a computer and screen, although the Wii is pretty eco-friendly.\\n\\nTry to turn off everything when it\'s not in use. When I was younger, I thought heat cycles would shorten the life of equipment. While that may still be true, obsolescence is probably going to kill it first. Just turn it off. Become a compulsive switch thrower.\\n\\nUse power strips with switches and turn them off to kill phantom power when not using things. This is my next project, to make a large, centralized charging station for all portables. With a giant power-strip feeding everything. One switch to turn off all that phantom power.\\n\\nThese tactics reduced our power bill by $500-$600 in the summer and $100-$200 in the winter. It\'s difficult to measure by dollars because while our monthly KWH consumption keeps falling, the power monopoly (PG&E) raises rates each year resulting in a bill roughly the same as the previous year despite a 10% reduction in usage.\\n\\nGo figure.\\n\\nOh, and that 10% is significant because we\'re on a tiered rate structure with about 30% of our power in the top tier. If I could reduce my power consumption by 25% it would cut my bill in half.', ' ""Is it winter or summer where you live right now?  I\'ll assume you live here in the US and it\'s winter-ish.\\n\\n1. Wear more clothes and get an energy efficient space heater.  We have ceiling heat and it\'s very expensive, so we rarely use it.  Our thermostat is set to 59 degrees, which seems cold, but you get used to it, especially if you wear a sweater and warm socks.\\n\\n2.) If you have a desktop computer, turn it off or put it on sleep when you\'re not using it.  Desktops and the monitor use a lot of juice when they\'re on.  Better yet, get a laptop.\\n\\n3).  Replace all your light bulbs with CFLs.  They\'re getting really cheap now, the light is finally as natural looking as a traditional bulb, they last forever (five years), and they use a fraction of the electricity.  Become a light-switch nazi.  Always turn off lights you don\'t need.  A single light left on doesn\'t cost much, but it really starts to add up over the course of a month.\\n\\n4).  Buy a plug-in skillet.  Studies have shown that cooking with a plug-in skillet instead of the electric burner on your stove uses about ten times less energy.  I\'m not making this up; I learned it in a class offered by my Utility Board (the legal monopoly).\\n\\n5).  Use a toaster, not a toaster oven.  Again, the toaster uses way less electricity.\\n\\n6). Plug your TV/Cable Box/DVD Player/Stereo into a power strip and turn the whole thing off at night before you go to bed.  Those things use electricity even when they\'re off.\\n\\n7.)  when you\'re done charging your cell phone / mp3 player / palm pilot / whatever, always unplug the power brick from the wall because they use electricity even they\'re not charging anything.\\n\\n8). if you haven\'t used it in 30 days, unplug it.\\n\\n9).  if you have a dishwasher, make sure to turn off the drying cycle.  Let the dishes air dry.  Who cares about a few spots.\\n\\n10).  Line dry your clothes instead of using the drier.  You can buy laundry racks at Walmart/Target for a few bucks.\\n\\n11).  Use the Cold/Cold cycle on your washer so your water heater won\'t use as much E.\\n\\n12).  Insulate your water heater, if you haven\'t already.   You can insulate it with traditional ceiling insulation and duct tape.  \\n\\n13).  If you pay for water as part of your utility bill, then I\'ve got about ten more suggestions for you.\\nI\'ll bet if you really tried you could shave off $100 dollars from that bill, perhaps even $150.', "" '[deleted]"", ' ""1) I own nothing that uses electricity except my laptop.\\n\\n2) I recharge that laptop\'s battery using a hand-crank generator that I built.']",No,No Violations," ""1) Move into somewhere with a flat-monthly inclusive rate for all utilities.\r\n\r\n2) Install a 42U server rack and fill it with as much stuff as I can.\r\n\r\n3) Don't bother conserving energy"

What didn\'t work for me was her telling us that when we opened our eyes the audience would be naked. I feel like the brain can add something (bad smell) but it can;t take away something it knows is there (clothes). Afterwards, I felt incredibly relaxed.

Get afternoon cocktails at a good bar.  I\'d recommend the columns (and I\'d recommend getting sazeracs there).  It\'s a beautiful bar, great drinks, and you can sit outside on their patio in one of the nicest neighborhoods in the city.  I would also recommend the sazerac room (hotel bar in the roosevelt, place where the sazerac was invented)...I haven\'t been there (closed after katrina recently reopened so I haven\'t had a chance) but my mother (who loves cocktails) highly reccomends it.\\n\\n3.  Get poboys/gumbo in the quarter, eat in jackson square, go see the cathedral (impt!  it\'s amazing)\\n\\n4.  The zoo is pretty nice and they had white tigers when i was there last time.\\n\\n5.  Balcony bar on magazine is also great (and v cheap, espeically during the afternoon).  Go get drinks, sit on the balcony, again very nice views.\\n\\n6.  Drink daquiris on the streetcar\\n\\n7.  definitely do the brass band thing, very fun\\n\\n8.  NOMA is good and has a great selection of impressionists (haven\'t been in awhile but i recall monet, manet, and degas in particular)\\n\\n9.  which reminds me, cafe degas is a great restaurant, very pretty (indoor trees, excellent ambiance, excellent food...great date spot (used to date a girl who lived 2 blocks from it in high school))\\n\\n10.  racetracks and degas\' house\\n\\n[8-10 are all within blocks of each other!  so maybe spend a day seeing racetracks/NOMA/degas\' house, then cafe degas for dinner]\\n\\n11.  a good friend of mine\'s parents own a delicious indian/creole fusion restaurant called sara\'s (sara being my friend) uptown (i\'d recommend the coconut shrimp)\\n\\n12.  my exes dad owns a cigar bar called dos jefes (also uptown)...they sell cigars, beer/liquor/decent wine selection, pool table, live jazz most nights\\n\\nhaha hope that\'s enough suggestions.

Too many great restaurants in NOLA to name.  But, here\'s a few:  If you want something upscale, of course there\'s Commander\'s Palace.  If you don\'t feel like springing for dinner there, their brunch is fan-fucking-tastic.  Check out Mother\'s across Canal from the Quarter for some down home goodness, but be prepared to wait.  Verdi Mart on Royal has awesome po-boys (get a french fry po-boy with roast beef gravy - trust me).  There are a ton of great Vietnamese places on the West Bank.

I\'ve run out of sympathy for the above, and I really struggle to see why anyone would have sympathy for them. These are people who have given up and are just trying to scrape by on guilt and at the bottom of the system. \n\n\nIt\'s made worse by the feeling I have that the majority of people in the third world would kill for their opportunity, and they\'ve completely thrown it away. America isn\'t perfect by a longshot, but enough opportunity still exists here that I believe anybody can be anything. I actually picked this up after talking to a few friends who came over here on visas during college from India.\n\n\nI feel the real people to be helping are the homeless people packing the libraries. One of the saddest things I\'ve ever seen is a floor of 200 computers completely full with job applications on most screens and a line of dozens of people waiting to use the computers. How do you even help them, though? They\'re helping themselves with the services of the city...and I think those are some of the best-spent tax dollars.\n\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. Please do share as well. I\'m quite interested.\n\n\ntl;dr - My opinion has evolved to be much more situational. People who want to change, do. \n\n\nedit: I\'m terrible at this reddit formatting"

They are also taught that what they are doing is actually a good and important thing for the \'customer\' and that it will save them money.\\n\\nThis scam was attempted on me a few years ago by a natural gas provider.

Could that be due to GRRM\'s inability to keep surprising his readers by topping the Red Wedding?  By the loss of POV characters the readers liked and the necessary introduction of completely new POV characters?\\n\\nOne thing that does encourage me, apparently GRRM has divulged the future plot to the writers of the HBO series, and presumably they have decided that they can make the story work for another four years.

1gfou7,AdviceAnimals,2013-06-16 04:21:27,"[' ""Please have your husband describe the symptoms to his primary care doctor. I had sleep apnea for a long time before someone told me how bad I snored. I had no idea how many health problems can be caused oxygen deprivation from sleep apnea. Before my sleep study  a few doctors had been trying to diagnose various symptoms. One I started using a CPAP machine, my health improved a lot.\\n\\n* Information below copied from National Institute of Health web site.\\n\\n[What Is Sleep Apnea?](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sleepapnea/)\\nSleep apnea (AP-ne-ah) is a common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep.\\n\\nBreathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound.\\n\\nSleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that disrupts your sleep. When your breathing pauses or becomes shallow, you’ll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep.\\n\\nAs a result, the quality of your sleep is poor, which makes you tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nSleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can\'t detect the condition during routine office visits. Also, no blood test can help diagnose the condition.\\n\\nMost people who have sleep apnea don\'t know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea.\\n\\nThe most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. This causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses.\\n\\nWhen you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight, but it can affect anyone. For example, small children who have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats may have obstructive sleep apnea.', ' ""Sleep apnea is absolutely terrifying when you\'re sleeping next to someone who has it.  So many sleepless nights full of elbowing your SO in the ribs to hear that sudden intake of breath, just to make sure they\'re still alive.', ' ""Earplugs are saving my relationship from this. It doesn\'t help with the kicking and sudden jerking though. Usually if they lose weight it helps a bit, too. ', ' ""Its 3:15am.. I\'m thinking the same thing about my husband right now. \\nOh wait, nm, there\'s the snoring again. :-/', "" 'Reading through these comments, it seems like everyone thinks this person has sleep apnea.  As a sleep technician, I think I have to agree.  What I find weird is that a lot of people are suggesting dealing with it by using earplugs or just otherwise coping with a bed partner that breathes like this during sleep.  CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) therapy works 90% of the time, and there are other PAP therapies for the 10% that are not fixed by CPAP.\\n\\nWHATEVER YOUR HUSBAND HAS, IT IS 100% TREATABLE!!! Sleep studies are getting easier and easier to go through.  There are a lot of wires in a sleep study, but sleep labs are essentially like hotels now.  Also, a lot of insurance companies (in America) are only paying for in home testing now, which means your husband would possibly only need to strap on a couple of belts, a cannula in his nose, and a pulseoximeter on his finger while sleeping at home to get a diagnosis.  Just a suggestion...\\n\\nEDIT: Including a link to the [Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)](http://www.stanford.edu/~dement/epworth.html) that can indicate if someone has excessive daytime sleepiness.

They may occur 30 times or more an hour. Typically, normal breathing then starts again, sometimes with a loud snort or choking sound.\\n\\nSleep apnea usually is a chronic (ongoing) condition that disrupts your sleep. When your breathing pauses or becomes shallow, you’ll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep.\\n\\nAs a result, the quality of your sleep is poor, which makes you tired during the day. Sleep apnea is a leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nSleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. Doctors usually can\'t detect the condition during routine office visits. Also, no blood test can help diagnose the condition.\\n\\nMost people who have sleep apnea don\'t know they have it because it only occurs during sleep. A family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea.\\n\\nThe most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea. In this condition, the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. This causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses.\\n\\nWhen you try to breathe, any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring. Obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight, but it can affect anyone.
